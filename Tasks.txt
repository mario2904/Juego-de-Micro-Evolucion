    + Implement delays
        + 100ms
        + 200ms
        + 400ms
+ Changed Delay implementation. Now it uses internal Timer.

Registers:

NAME    | WHERE                                 | Description
__________________________________________________________________________________
R15     | Throughout the game (Changes)         | Value of chosen number
R14     | Subroutines COMMANDLCD and WRITELCD   | Used to pass value to subroutine
R13     | Subroutine WRITESTR and WRITEMSG      | Used to pass value and as Iterator
R4      | Throughout the game (Stays the same)  | Holds the value of difficulty
R5      | Throughout the game (Changes)         | Holds the value of current level
